                    <p>The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football
                        competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération
                        Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The
                        championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in
                        1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion is
                        France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.</p>
